- Create a Java project that shows a solution to the Leaders-Followers problem. 
- The solution must be implemented as a Java(s) class that utilises only semaphores.  
- Your code should display the solution in action and demonstrate that it is working correctly.  
- As always the project must be documented using JavaDoc and uploaded to your lab Github repository.
